          , I set out to explore what life looks like for young Canadians â€” both
          in terms of their real-life situations (like education and employment)
          and their perspectives on politics and society.

          This interactive website brings together survey responses and official
          statistics to paint a fuller picture of youth in Canada today.
          Engaging visualizations help make this data easier to understand for
          Canadians and global audiences alike.

        <p>
          I'm part of the generation this project focuses on. I've seen how many
          young Canadians are navigating uncertainty around employment,
          education, and the future. Youth voices are often underrepresented in
          policy conversations, and I wanted to help amplify them through data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focused on election, education, and employment data â€” key areas that
          shape young people's opportunities and experiences.
