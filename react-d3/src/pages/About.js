          , I set out to explore what life looks like for young Canadians â€” both
          in terms of their situations (employment and education) and their
          perspectives on politics and society. This project aims to make
          youth-focused data more accessible and understandable through
          engaging, interactive visualizations.

            (CES) was conducted to document the attitudes of Canadians during
            and after the 2021 election. It was also designed to mimic the
            distributions in the population. For my visualization, I filtered to
            only include survey respondents under the age of 30. I also have not
            included questions that have over 20 responses, which includes
            questions that contains 0-100 scales and open-ended questions. For
